\section*{Abstract}
In the recent year, Deep Learning has seen a rapid surge of interest across academia and industry. One of the main factor that contribute to the rise of Deep Learning is the successful applications of convolutions neural network by using very deep and advance model like VGG-net and  Res-Net image.
However, in order to effectively utilize the power of it, we still need to gather a large amount of data, especially labeled data, which sometimes require an expert to do the task. On the other hand, unlabeled has become much cheaper and easier to obtain and because of that, active learning has become one of the main approach to reduce labeling cost without scarifying performance. In this report, we will look at the current state of the art works in active learning and compare their performance on a pre-trained deep convolutional network. ++++
